PROGRAM converts infix expression to postfix expression

[for prefix]
set infix expression to the reversed infix expression

START:

PUT "#" at the end of the infix expression

repeat until "#" sentinel is encountered:

	if operand encountered then push into the 		expression

	if operator encountered then:
  
		if encountered operator precendence is lower than the top operator in stack then:
			a) Pop the operator from the stack and push into expression
			b) Push the encountered operator into the stack
		else: 
			push the encountered operator into the stack
		[end if]

		if ")" is encountered then: 
			a) Pop the operators continuously until "(" is encountered and push them into expression one by one
		[end if]
	[end if]
[end of loop]

[for prefix]
reverse the generated expression and store into expression variable 

[for postfix]
set expression to the expression generated by the loop

exit
